# Collection of Bash-Scripts
This is my collection of bash-scripts I consider useful on a daily base use.

## List of scripts
Until now it contains following scripts:

- pdfresize
- ~~huge_bash_code~~

nothing more so far ;) I'm willing to make this repo growth though. In the
meanwhile, feel free to make whatever you want to/with the scripts. Even if I'd
consider them secure and use them for my own tasks, I want to make clear you're
using them on your own risk... :octocat:
