# Collection of Bash-Scripts
This is my repository of bash-scripts I considered useful on a daily base use.

## List of scripts
Until now my collection contains following scripts:

- pdfresize
- ~~huge_bash_code~~

nothing more so far ;) I'm keen to make this repo growth in the nearer future.
Until then, feel free to make whatever you want (see license agreement below!).
Since I maintain my repo for fun, I want to point out you're using every script
on your own risk... :octocat: Shouldn't do no harm though!

## Usage
Clone this repo and drop the scripts in your ~/bin directory. Make them
executable with `chmod 755 ~/bin/<script>` and send me any type of comments
and/or issues.
